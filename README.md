ABSTRACT
Starting from the idea of needing to digitize the process of selection and cus- tomization when talking about purchasing an apartment, this web application comes to help the customer in order to simplify the whole action. This web ap- plication has been developed to facilitate the selection and filtering process of the offers from different real estate developers. The concept of the application was that the user may benefit from an advantage, having different ways of choice and personalization.
The SaleHome computer system offers the customer the possibility to select a city where he wants to buy an apartment and then to choose the number of rooms, but also the date when it has to be ready. Once these items are selected, the cus- tomer receives the offers that match his selection and then the customization moves to the next step, the user chooses by preferences the number of bedrooms, bath- rooms and square meters. The result obtained is presented to the client with all the corresponding details, including the architecture of the house, plus an option for customizing some interior design features. The user selects the model of tiles, floor tiles and parquet that he wants in the apartment, and the web application displays the final design according to the chosen options.
The entire application was developed based on new technologies, in full ascent, which facilitate the entire development process, but also provide the customer a pleasant experience with a great flow. The web application is very adaptive and responsive through its technologies. NextJS, a full stack React framework, gives the application a well-defined structure based on its data processing and rendering features. ReactJS, the library used in this system is flexible with speed development process advantages, and in terms of the TailwindCSS framework, the customer enjoys a pleasant design and an extremely interactive experience.




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
